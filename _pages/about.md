<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Research Associate Professor at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)](https://cse.sustech.edu.cn/), [Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/), Shenzhen, China.

I obtained my Bachelor degree from Southwest Jiaotong University in 2010, Master degree from Beijing Jiaotong University in 2013, and Ph.D. degree from Institut National des Sciences Appliquées de Rouen Normandie (INSA Rouen Normandie), France, in 2018. From March 2018 to September 2020, I was a Post-Doctor in Prof. [Xin Yao](https://cse.sustech.edu.cn/faculty/~xiny/)'s group at the CSE of SUSTech. Then, from October 2020 to September 2023, I served as a Research Assistant Professor at the same group in SUSTech.

My research interests mainly include Artificial Intelligence (AI) Ethics, Trustworthy Machine Learning (ML), and Evolutionary Computation. I have published more than 30 research papers with total <a href='https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=QRnmYfkAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>500+</span></strong></a>.

<div class='paper-box-text' markdown="1">

I run the WeChat pulic account **AI Ethics**. The continuously emerging risk issues in the development and application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) have drawn significant global attention. Emphasizing AI ethics, strengthening AI governance, and developing trustworthy AI have become a global consensus. This public account is dedicated to sharing knowledge and updates related to AI ethics, AI governance, and trustworthy AI.

**Impact Statement:** AI ethics is an important emerging topic among academia, industry, government, society, and individuals. In the past decades, many efforts have been made to study the ethical issues in AI. This article offers a comprehensive overview of the AI ethics field, including a summary and analysis of AI ethical issues, ethical guidelines and principles, approaches to address AI ethical issues, and methods to evaluate the ethics of AI technologies. Additionally, research challenges and future perspectives are discussed. This article will help researchers to gain a birds eye view of AI ethics, and thus facilitate their further investigation and research of AI.
