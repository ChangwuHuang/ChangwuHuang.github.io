I am currently a Research Associate Professor in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)](https://cse.sustech.edu.cn/) at [Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/), Shenzhen, China. I received my Bachelor‚Äôs degree from Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China, in 2010, Master‚Äôs degree from Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China, in 2013, and Ph.D. degree from Institut National des Sciences Appliqu√©es de Rouen Normandie (INSA Rouen Normandie), Rouen, France, in 2018. Since March 2018, I have been a member of Professor [Xin Yao](https://cse.sustech.edu.cn/faculty/~xiny/)‚Äôs team at SUSTech, serving consecutively as a Postdoctoral Fellow (03/2018-09/2020), Research Assistant Professor (10/2020-09/2023), and Research Associate Professor (10/2023-Present). My research interests mainly include Artificial Intelligence Ethics (AI Ethics), Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (Trustworthy AI), Evolutionary Computation (EC), and their practical applications.


## Research Interests

Through my educational pursuits and professional experiences, I have cultivated a robust interdisciplinary research background. During my doctoral studies, I specialized in applying AI techniques (e.g., machine learning and evolutionary algorithms) to address engineering problems, particularly uncertainty analysis, material parameter identification, and fatigue damage analysis in mechanical engineering. Transitioning into my postdoctoral role from March 2018 to September 2020, I concentrated on the automatic algorithm configuration for AI algorithms, specifically for evolutionary algorithms and other intelligent optimization algorithms. Since late 2020, my research trajectory has evolved towards the areas of AI ethics and trustworthy AI, which are not only current global research trends but also pivotal future developmental directions of AI. At present, my research is centered on AI Ethics and Trustworthy AI, with a strong emphasis on essential ethical considerations including transparency, explainability, fairness, safety, and privacy. I have published more than 30 research papers with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QRnmYfkAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>600+</span></strong></a>. 

- **AI Ethics** is an emerging multidisciplinary research field that investigates ethical issues and societal impacts arising from the design, development, implementation, and use of AI technologies. My efforts span the exploration of Ethical Issues and Challenges in AI, Ethical Guidelines and Principles for AI, and AI Ethical Governance Practice.

- **Trustworthy AI** aims to develop AI systems that are aligned with ethical principles (such as transparency, fairness, privacy, safety, security, accountability, etc.), fostering trust from users and society in AI technologies. My research is centered on Explainable Machine Learning, Fairness-Aware Machine Learning, and Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning.

- **Evolutionary Computation** is a computational methodology inspired by biological evolution and natural selection for addressing optimization and search problems. My research involves Surrogate-Assisted Evolutionary Optimization, Automatic Algorithm Configuration (Parameter Tuning), and Surrogate Modeling in engineering tasks (e.g., uncertainty analysis, fatigue damage analysis, material parameter identification).

[Multi-objective Feature Attribution Explanation for Explainable Machine Learning](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3617380)

Ziming Wang, **Changwu Huang**, Yun Li, Xin Yao*

[**Project**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=QRnmYfkAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=QRnmYfkAAAAJ:geHnlv5EZngC) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='QRnmYfkAAAAJ:geHnlv5EZngC'></span></strong>

The feature attribution-based explanation (FAE) methods, which indicate how much each input feature contributes to the model‚Äôs output for a given data point, are one of the most popular categories of explainable machine learning techniques. This work formulates the problem of creating FAE explainable models as a multi-objective learning problem that considers multiple explanation quality metrics simultaneously. Experimental results comparing with six state-of-the-art FAE methods on eight datasets demonstrate that our method can optimize multiple conflicting metrics simultaneously and can provide explanations with higher faithfulness, lower sensitivity, and lower complexity than the compared methods. Moreover, the results have shown that our method has better diversity, i.e., it provides various explanations that achieve different tradeoffs between multiple conflicting explanation quality metrics. Therefore, it can provide tailored explanations to different stakeholders based on their specific requirements.

[Estimation of Probability Distribution of Long-term Fatigue Damage on Wind Turbine Tower using Residual Neural Network](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888327023000080)

Hao Bai, Lujie Shi, Younes Aoues, **Changwu Huang***, Didier Lemosse

[**Project**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=QRnmYfkAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=QRnmYfkAAAAJ:vRqMK49ujn8C) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='QRnmYfkAAAAJ:vRqMK49ujn8C'></span></strong>

Fatigue is one of the most significant failure modes in structural and mechanical design. However, fatigue analysis usually suffers from two main challenges: 1) fatigue failure is hard to be predicted accurately, and 2) numerical fatigue damage estimation approaches are time-consuming. To overcome these drawbacks, this work firstly proposes a probabilistic fatigue analysis framework to estimate the fatigue damage of wind turbine tower based on numerical simulations. Then, to reduce the computational cost of numerical approach, a residual neural network (ResNet)-assisted fatigue estimation approach is designed for the assessment of long-term fatigue loads under the proposed probabilistic fatigue analysis framework, where machine learning model is used to approximate the relationship between the load (i.e., wind speed in our study case) and the fatigue damage so that a large number of simulations can be replaced by model prediction. Our proposed method is validated by numerical studies with a state-of-the-art wind turbine and has been applied in a wind turbine design with real-world wind loads.

[Online Algorithm Configuration for Differential Evolution Algorithm](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10489-021-02752-1)

**Changwu Huang**, Hao Bai, Xin Yao*

[**Project**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=QRnmYfkAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=QRnmYfkAAAAJ:uWQEDVKXjbEC) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='QRnmYfkAAAAJ:uWQEDVKXjbEC'></span></strong>

The performance of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) is strongly affected by their configurations. Thus, algorithm configuration (AC) problem, that is, to properly set algorithm‚Äôs configuration, including the operators and parameter values for maximizing the algorithm‚Äôs performance on given problem(s) is an essential and challenging task in the design and application of EAs. In this paper, an online algorithm configuration (OAC) approach is proposed for differential evolution (DE) algorithm to adapt its configuration in a data-driven way. In our proposed OAC, the multi-armed bandit algorithm is adopted to select trial vector generation strategies for DE, and the kernel density estimation method is used to adapt the associated control parameters during the evolutionary search process.

**Changwu Huang**, Yuanxiang Li, Xin Yao*

[**Project**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=QRnmYfkAAAAJ&citation_for_view=QRnmYfkAAAAJ:bFI3QPDXJZMC) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='QRnmYfkAAAAJ:bFI3QPDXJZMC'></span></strong>

Parameter tuning, that is, to find appropriate parameter settings (or configurations) of algorithms so that their performance is optimized, is an important task in the development and application of metaheuristics. Automating this task, i.e., developing algorithmic procedure to address parameter tuning task, is highly desired and has attracted significant attention from the researchers and practitioners. During last two decades, many automatic parameter tuning approaches have been proposed. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of automatic parameter tuning methods for metaheuristics. A new classification (or taxonomy) of automatic parameter tuning methods is introduced according to the structure of tuning methods. The existing automatic parameter tuning approaches are reviewed and their main strengths and weaknesses are discussed, which is helpful for new researchers or practitioners to select appropriate tuning methods to use.
