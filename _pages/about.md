I obtained my Bachelor degree from Southwest Jiaotong University in 2010, Master degree from Beijing Jiaotong University in 2013, and Ph.D. degree from Institut National des Sciences Appliquées de Rouen Normandie (INSA Rouen Normandie), France, in 2018. From Mar. 2018 to Sept. 2020, I was a Post-Doctor with the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), Shenzhen, China. I am currently a Research Associate Professor at the CSE of SUSTech. 

My research interest includes Artificial Intelligence (AI) Ethics, Trustworthy Machine Learning (ML), and Evolutionary Computation. I have published more than 30 research papers with total <a href='https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=QRnmYfkAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>500+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).
